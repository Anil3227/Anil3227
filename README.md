## 🌟 About Me

I’m a graduate-level scientific coder and cosmology enthusiast focused on developing analytical and computational tools to better understand the universe’s evolution — from **inflationary dynamics** to **late-time dark energy behavior**.  
I transform theoretical physics ideas into reproducible code, simulations, and published research utilities that help both students and researchers.

- 🎓 Field of study: **Cosmology, Early Universe & Dark Energy**
- 💻 Interests: Scientific computing, Python, Jupyter, Data analysis
- 🤝 Always open to collaborations on open-source scientific tools!
